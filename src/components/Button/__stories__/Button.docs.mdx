## Description
Buttons act as a trigger for certain actions. While this is their main purpose, in very rare cases,
they are used in place of links to navigate to a different page.

Buttons are also used in dialog boxes when the interface suggests that users perform some alternative actions.
For example, continue or return to editing.

## Appearance
To design the UI of cloud services, we use 5 basic (`action`, `normal`, `outline`, `flat`, `raised`),
5 additional (`outline-info`, `outline-danger`, `flat-info`, `flat-danger`, `flat-secondary`),
and 3 special (`normal-contrast`, `outline-contrast`, `flat-contrast`) types of buttons.
The button's appearance is controlled by the `view` property.

### Action
This is the most prominent button, used for the primary action on a screen, which requires the most attention.
We recommend only using one such button per page (excluding dialog boxes).

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewAction.code} />
<ButtonExampleViewAction/>

### Normal
This is the main type of button (used by default). It is designed for secondary actions or when you have to maintain
the importance of an action without drawing too much attention to it.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewNormal.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewNormal/>

### Outline
Used for secondary actions that require less attention on a page. It can be used both with the main button and without it (only with an accented one).

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewOutlined.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewOutlined/>

### Flat
Used for auxiliary actions that require the least attention on a page. It is often used in a list of buttons or action icons (with no text) in an editor.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewFlat.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewFlat/>

### Raised
The button placed above the content, usually with a fixed location.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewRaised.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewRaised/>

### Outlined-info
Used to indicate where to go to a different service or external resource.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewOutlinedInfo.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewOutlinedInfo/>

### Flat-info
Used to indicate where to go to a different service or external resource.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewFlatInfo.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewFlatInfo/>

### Outline-danger
Danger buttons are used to indicate dangerous actions such as delete, stop, restart, or escape.
`outline-danger` is used when there is enough space to place a full-featured button on a page or in a modal window.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewOutlinedDanger.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewOutlinedDanger/>

### Flat-danger
Used to indicate a destructive action in a general list of actions on an object or in a drop-down menu.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewFlatDanger.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewFlatDanger/>

### Flat-secondary
This button is less accented than a `flat` button. It's often used as the secondary button in dialog boxes and modal windows.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewFlatSecondary.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewFlatSecondary/>

### Special
Buttons `normal-contrast`, `outline-contrast`, `flat-contrast` used to highlight actions against a complex background (for example, in a banner or against a color background).
The usage type depends on the required degree of display.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={ButtonExampleViewSpecial.code}/>
<ButtonExampleViewSpecial/>

## Button text
The name of a button should uniquely identify what happens if you click it. If it's an action, it should answer the question "What does it do?".

- Button names should begin with a capital letter (Save, Rename, Create disk, or Add endpoint).
- Actions on a page or in a modal window should be consistent with their headers (such as Create virtual disk, Create, or Cancel).
- If it's a link, it should answer the question "What?" or "What does it do?".

## States
<ButtonExampleState/>

1. Default – The main state of a button that a user can interact with.
2. Disabled – The state when a button is unavailable for some reason.
3. Loading – The state when the user has performed an action and is waiting for a system response.
4. Selected – The state when the user can switch between "Enable" and "Disable".

## Size
<ButtonExampleSize/>

S – Used when standard buttons are too big (tables, small cards).

M – Basic size, used in most components.

L – Basic actions performed in a page's header, modal windows, or pop-ups.

XL – Used on promo and landing pages.
