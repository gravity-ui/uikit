## Description
Link - is a part of the text, that, when clicked, takes the user to another part of the page, another page inside the service, or to a page of another external service.

The main difference from the [Buttons](/docs/components-button) is the navigation function. Links more often lead to other pages or open new browser tabs.

## Appearance
There can be three types: `normal`(the usual brown), `primary`(black), `secondary`(gray). it is controlled by the `view` property. It is also possible to display visited state using the `visitable` property.

### Normal
The most familiar and well-established pattern of use for users. It is used to visually highlight an element inside a text, table, and as part of navigation. It is used to navigate to pages inside the service and to external sources, including documentation. Also, they are used on error pages and zero states.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={LinkExampleViewNormal.code}/>
<LinkExampleViewNormal/>

### Primary
They are used when it is natively clear to the user that it is possible to interact with an element, but visually using blue links will overload the interface and disrupt the balance of accents on the page.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={LinkExampleViewPrimary.code}/>
<LinkExampleViewPrimary/>

### Secondary
Like primary links, they are used when it is natively clear to the user that an element can be interacted with, and the need to navigate through them is secondary and affects a small number of scenarios. The main task is not to argue with the accents on the page. It is more often used in bread crumbs or when displaying secondary attributes.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={LinkExampleViewSecondary.code}/>
<LinkExampleViewSecondary/>

### Visitable
Used to show that the link has already been visited.

<DocsSource language="tsx" code={LinkExampleVisitable.code}/>
<LinkExampleVisitable/>

## Href
`href` property is optional. If it is absent, then Link wil act like Button.
<DocsSource language="tsx" code={LinkExampleHref.code}/>
<LinkExampleHref/>

## Usage
Ð¡an be used as an independent text element, or as part of the text
<DocsSource language="tsx" code={LinkExampleUsage.code}/>
<LinkExampleUsage/>

## Properties
<ArgsTable of={Link}/>
